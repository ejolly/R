##General dump of various R code

*If you're looking for my academic research projects, they're likely located in the [Dartmouth CosanLab Repository](https://github.com/cosanlab)*  

This repo includes:

- code from various for "fun projects"
- guides/how-tos for R specific things
- guides/how-tos for statistical things
- code not otherwise linked to a specific project

To view html files in this repo generated from R Markdown just paste the github file URL into [githubHTMLPreview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/)*

**Some html files with figures may not render in the htmlpreview site. Sometimes (if I remember) I also include a github-flavored md file that should just render natively in github without need for the htmlpreview site. I have noticed that these files don't always render properly/look poorly formatted, so if you can't get an html file to render/things looks weird, your best bet is to checkout my [personal website](http://eshinjolly.com) to see if I've linked to it there, or to download the .Rmd file and knit it in your preferred format.*
